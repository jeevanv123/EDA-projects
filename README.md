In this repository I have uploaded two EDA projects with its dataset.

      In this dataset we have the data of houses in Brazil for which I am analysing the data using python data visualization
      And also find insights and conclusions based on our exploratory data analysis
-- 2. Repayment of credit :

      In this dataset we have the data of customer of a bank where we determine the defaulting of customers using EDA
